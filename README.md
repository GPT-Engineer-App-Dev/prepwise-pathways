Create a landing page called "NeetCode" with the following specifications:

### Purpose
The NeetCode landing page is designed to help users prepare effectively for coding interviews through a structured and interactive interface. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the page:

#### Header:
- **Navigation Bar**: Located at the top of the page, the navigation bar includes:
  - **Logo**: A rocket icon symbolizing NeetCode, placed at the leftmost corner.
  - **Menu Items**: Three primary links labeled "Courses," "Practice," and "Roadmap," providing easy access to different sections of the platform.
  - **Pro Account Button**: A button labeled "Pro," highlighted in green, for users to upgrade their account.
  - **Sign In Button**: A "Sign in" button on the right side for users to access their accounts.
  - **Dark/Light Mode Switch**: An icon to toggle between dark mode and light mode, enhancing user experience based on their preference.

#### Main Content:
- **Hero Section**:
  - **Title**: Boldly displays "NeetCode."
  - **Tagline**: "A better way to prepare for coding interviews," succinctly describes the platformâ€™s purpose.
  - **Call-to-Action Button**: A green button labeled "Get Pro" encourages users to upgrade for additional features.

- **Flowchart Section**:
  - **Description**: The flowchart visually outlines various coding interview topics and their interconnections.
  - **Nodes and Connections**:
    - **Arrays & Hashing**: This root node branches into:
      - **Two Pointers**
      - **Stack**
    - **Two Pointers**: This intermediate node branches into:
      - **Sliding Window**
      - **Linked List**
    - **Stack**: This intermediate node branches into:
      - **Binary Search**
    - **Linked List** and **Binary Search** converge into:
      - **Trees**
    - **Trees**: This central node branches into:
      - **Tries**
      - **Heap / Priority Queue**
      - **Backtracking**

Each node represents a key topic in coding interviews, with branches illustrating the progression and connections between these topics. For instance, understanding Arrays & Hashing can lead to mastering Two Pointers and Stack, which further branch into more specialized areas like Sliding Window and Linked List.

### Visual Design:
- **Theme**: The page uses a dark theme by default, providing a modern and visually appealing look. The dark mode switch allows users to toggle between dark and light modes, accommodating different viewing preferences.
- **Layout**: The design is clean and minimalistic, focusing on guiding users through the preparation process with clarity and ease.

This comprehensive landing page layout ensures that users have a clear understanding of the preparation path for coding interviews, starting from basic concepts and advancing to more complex topics, all within an intuitive and interactive interface.
